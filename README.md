# reMXML
reMXML is a project written in JavaScript designed to output compilable MXML components from decompiled ActionScript files generated in [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) from Apache/Adobe Flex SWFs. The intended use case for this project is to decompile GoAnimate applications, thought it should be able to be applied to other things, so long as it was made in Flex.
